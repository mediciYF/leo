<p>Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity.</p>
<p>He conceptualized flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, 
concentrated solar power, an adding machine,[13]</p>
<p>and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs 
were constructed or even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern 
scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering</p>
<p> were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however,</p>
<p> entered the world of manufacturing unheralded,
 such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the </p>
<p>tensile strength of wire.He is also sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter,</p>
<p> and tank.[14][15] He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, geology, optics,</p>
<p> and hydrodynamics, but he did not</p>
<p> publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.</p>
